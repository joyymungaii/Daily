        <p>
          Bear cubs are called "cubs" for both male and female bears. <br>Bears can
          walk on their hind legs to get a better view or to <br>reach something
          high. Polar bears have black skin under their <br>white fur, which helps
          absorb heat from the sun.

      <p>Polar bears have thick, fluffy coats to stay warm in the Arctic.
        They love to eat ice and are excellent swimmers.
        Polar bear cubs are very small when they are born.
        They have dark brown eyes to help them see in the snow.
        Polar bears are fascinating creatures adapted to life in the harsh Arctic environment.</p>
