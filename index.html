        <p>
          Bear cubs are called "cubs" for both male and female bears.
          <br />Bears can walk on their hind legs to get a better view or to
          <br />reach something high. Polar bears have black skin under their
          <br />white fur, which helps absorb heat from the sun.

        <h2>Polar Bears</h2>
        <p>
          Polar bears have thick, fluffy coats to stay warm in the <br />Arctic.
          They love to eat ice and are excellent swimmers. <br />Polar bear cubs
          are very small when they are born. <br />They have dark brown eyes to
          help them see in the snow. <br />Polar bears are fascinating creatures
          adapted to life in the <br />
          harsh Arctic environment.

        <h2>Spirit bear</h2>
        <p>
          Spirit bears, also known as Kermode bears, are a rare white variant of
          the <br />
          American black bear found in British Columbia, Canada. Their striking
          <br />
          white fur is caused by a recessive genetic mutation. Despite their
          unique <br />appearance, they are genetically identical to black
          bears. Spirit bears are <br />typically smaller than their black
          counterparts and have a slightly different <br />diet, often
          preferring salmon. These elusive creatures are a symbol of the
          <br />pristine wilderness of British Columbia and are closely
          protected by <br />
          conservation efforts.
